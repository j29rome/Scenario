# Response to Request to Bump Up to Advanced Track

Hi John,

Thank you for your email and for sharing more about your background! We truly appreciate your enthusiasm for joining the Advanced track of our Technical Interview Prep program.

While we admire your academic achievements and understand your interest in the Advanced track, we base admissions on pre-work scores and technical interview skills to ensure that every student is placed in a course that best matches their current skill level. Our goal is to provide the most effective learning experience for each student, and placing them in the right track ensures that they receive the right level of challenge without feeling overwhelmed or underprepared.

The first few topics in both the **Intermediate** and **Advanced** tracks may seem similar, but the pacing and depth of each track are tailored to the specific skill levels of the students. For example, in the **Advanced track**, we dive into more complex concepts more quickly, while in the **Intermediate track**, we build foundational skills at a pace that ensures everyone can keep up and absorb the material effectively.

We believe the **Intermediate track** will be the best fit for you at this stage. It will provide the right level of challenge to help you sharpen your skills, and you’ll be able to progress to more advanced topics as you gain more experience. We want to make sure you get the best learning experience possible, which is why it's important that we place students based on their current abilities.

You can find more information about both tracks through the links below:

- [Advanced Track Overview](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/tip103/syllabus)

We’re excited to have you in the Intermediate track, and we’re confident that it will help you build the skills necessary to succeed in your future career.

Thank you again for your understanding, and we look forward to seeing you in the course!

Best regards,
