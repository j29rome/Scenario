# Applicant who is outside of the US

Hi Jane,

Thank you for your thoughtful message, and for sharing your dedication to completing the pre-work. We genuinely appreciate the time and effort you've put into your application.

We understand your frustration, and we want to clarify that the eligibility restrictions are in place due to the current sponsorships we receive as a non-profit organization. At the moment, our courses are only available to students enrolled at partner universities within the United States.

Although we recognize the significant effort you've put into building your app, unfortunately, we’re unable to make exceptions for applicants outside of the US at this time. We hope to expand our reach in the future, and we’ll keep you updated should this change.

We truly empathize with your situation and wish we could offer more flexibility. Please don’t hesitate to check out our resources page for free content that can help in your journey, and feel free to sign up for our mailing list to stay informed about any upcoming programs or events.

Best regards,
