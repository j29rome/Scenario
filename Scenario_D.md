# Student who wants to be put back to the course after being withdrawn

Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out, and we truly appreciate your willingness to make up for the missed coursework.

As per our course policy, students are withdrawn from the course if the required coursework is not completed. In your case, we had not received a response to our previous messages asking for the reason behind the missed submissions, which is why you were removed from the course.

However, we want to assure you that you still have lifetime access to the course materials, and you can revisit the content whenever you’re ready to catch up. Unfortunately, we cannot reinstate you into the current cohort due to the nature of our courses, but we encourage you to continue learning at your own pace.

If you need any guidance or help with the material, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to support you in your learning journey.

Best regards,  
Jerome Alumbro  
TIP101 Course Team
