# Applicant who missed the deadline

Hi Anne,

Thank you for reaching out, and we’re really sorry to hear about the challenges you’ve been facing in securing an internship offer. We understand how important it is for you to get the necessary interview prep before graduation.

Unfortunately, as the Summer Interview Prep course is now full and we have a long waitlist, we are unable to offer you a spot in this year’s course. We do offer this course every summer, but we understand that you will be graduating and will not be eligible to apply next year.

We would like to help you as much as we can. We have a high-level software interview guide filled with useful tips and guidelines that you can use to continue preparing. You can access it [here](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view). Additionally, feel free to check out our resources page for other free content that might be of help. 

We also invite you to sign up for our mailing list, where we share information on future courses and virtual events that might be relevant to your career journey.

Wishing you all the best in your internship search, and we hope to stay in touch.

Best regards,  
Jerome Alumbro  
Interview Prep Team
